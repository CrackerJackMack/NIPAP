Synopsis
--------
**nipap-passwd** action [options...]

Description
-----------
The **nipap-passwd** command administrates user accounts in a local (SQLite)
database for use with the NIPAP backend. The NIPAP backend can be configured to
use a "local" authentication backend, which is implemented with a SQLite
database. This utility provides an easy way to add, remove or change users in
such a database.

By default, **nipap-passwd** will read the NIPAP configuration file
(/etc/nipap/nipap.conf) to find the location of the SQLite database.

Options
-------
**nipapd-passwd** accepts the following command-line arguments.

 positional arguments:
    action {list, add, delete, test-user, create-database, upgrade-database, latest-version}      define an action to execute

    list
        List all users in the SQLite database.

    add
        Add user with username specified with **-u** and password specified
        with **-p** to the database.

    delete
        Delete user with username specifies with **-u** from the database

    modify
        Modify an existing user. User to modify is specified with **-u**. It is
        not possible to change the username of an existing user.

    test-user
        Try to authenticate with user specified with the option **-u** and
        password speficied with **-p**. The program will return exit code **2**
        if the user does not exist or the password is wrong.

        or by option **-f**

    upgrade-database
